# Urban Governance and Social Policy Research (Latin America)

This repository presents selected research projects at the intersection of urban governance, territorial inequality, and social policy in Latin America. My research integrates geospatial analysis, causal inference, and computational social science to examine how institutional arrangements shape spatial patterns of vulnerability and social exclusion in urban contexts.

The projects compiled here reflect a broader research agenda focused on:

- Urban marginality and territorial inequality  
- Homelessness, housing exclusion, and institutional responses  
- Public security governance and social vulnerability  
- Evidence-based public policy design  
- Comparative perspectives between Latin America and Europe  

By combining quantitative methods with institutional analysis, this research seeks to contribute to comparative debates on governance, inequality, and policy effectiveness.

## About

I am a quantitative social scientist with a PhD in Data Science, specializing in the application of rigorous quantitative methods to complex social problems. My research focuses on urban marginality, homelessness, housing exclusion, public security governance, and evidence-based social policy evaluation in Latin America.

By combining spatial data analysis, quasi-experimental designs, and institutional research, I seek to contribute to comparative debates on governance, inequality, and public policy effectiveness.


## Selected Research Projects

### 1. Spatial Policy Impact – Geospatial Causal Framework

### 3. AI-Supported Public Health Governance (Ongoing Project)

Ongoing collaborative development of a data-driven decision-support framework in partnership with the State Health Secretariat. The initiative aims to integrate structured and unstructured public health data to enhance institutional coordination and evidence-based policy planning.
