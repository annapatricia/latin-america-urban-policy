# Urban Governance and Social Policy Research (Latin America)

This repository presents selected research projects at the intersection of urban governance, territorial inequality, and social policy in Latin America. My research integrates geospatial analysis, causal inference, and computational social science to examine how institutional arrangements shape spatial patterns of vulnerability and social exclusion in urban contexts.

The projects compiled here reflect a broader research agenda focused on:

- Urban marginality and territorial inequality  
- Homelessness, housing exclusion, and institutional responses  
- Public security governance and social vulnerability  
- Evidence-based public policy design  
- Comparative perspectives between Latin America and Europe  

By combining quantitative methods with institutional analysis, this research seeks to contribute to comparative debates on governance, inequality, and policy effectiveness.

## Selected Research Projects

### 1. Spatial Policy Impact – Geospatial Causal Framework

Development of a spatial causal inference framework for evaluating territorial effects of public policies. This project constructs spatial panels and applies quasi-experimental methods to examine governance outcomes and urban inequality patterns.

---

### 2. Geo Policy Impact – Spatial Diagnostics of Urban Vulnerability

Georeferenced analysis of socioeconomic concentration patterns using GIS-based methodologies to identify territorial inequality and inform evidence-based urban policymaking.

---

### 3. AI-Supported Public Health Governance (Ongoing Project)

Collaborative development of a data-driven decision-support framework in partnership with a public health institution. The initiative aims to enhance institutional coordination and evidence-based planning through integrated data systems and analytical modeling.
