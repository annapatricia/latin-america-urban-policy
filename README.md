# Data Science for Urban Governance and Social Policy (Latin America)

This repository presents selected research projects at the intersection of urban governance, territorial inequality, and social policy in Latin America. My work applies data science to complex social problems, integrating geospatial analysis, causal inference, and computational social science to examine how institutional arrangements shape spatial patterns of vulnerability and social exclusion in urban contexts.

The projects compiled here reflect a broader research agenda focused on:

- Urban marginality and territorial inequality  
- Homelessness, housing exclusion, and institutional responses  
- Public security governance and social vulnerability  
- Evidence-based social policy design  
- Comparative perspectives across Latin America and Europe  

By combining rigorous quantitative methods with institutional analysis, this research contributes to comparative debates on governance, inequality, and policy effectiveness.

## About

I am a quantitative social scientist with a PhD in Data Science, specializing in the application of advanced quantitative methods to urban governance and social policy challenges in Latin America. My research investigates how public institutions respond to territorial inequality, urban marginality, and social vulnerability.

Through the integration of spatial data analysis, quasi-experimental designs, and computational modeling, I seek to generate empirically grounded insights that support evidence-based policymaking and comparative research on governance and inequality.

## Selected Research Projects

### 1. Spatial Policy Impact – Geospatial Causal Framework

Development of a spatial causal inference framework for evaluating territorial effects of public policies. The project constructs spatial panels and applies quasi-experimental methods to assess governance outcomes and urban inequality patterns.

### 2. Geo Policy Impact – Spatial Diagnostics of Urban Vulnerability

Georeferenced analysis of socioeconomic concentration patterns using GIS-based methodologies to identify territorial inequality and inform urban policy interventions.
