 🤖 Secure Chatbot with Guardrails (FastAPI + Render)

Design and implementation of a public, globally accessible chatbot focused on safety, control, and clean architecture. 
The system applies multiple guardrail layers, including input validation, intent and risk analysis, policy enforcement, and controlled responses.

The application is deployed on cloud infrastructure (Render), exposes a REST API built with FastAPI, and includes a lightweight HTML/JavaScript web interface for real-time interaction via browser or mobile devices.

Key concepts:
• Guardrails for prompt injection and misuse prevention  
• Intent classification and risk assessment  
• Policy engine for response control  
• Cloud deployment with CI/CD via GitHub  
• Public web interface without authentication
